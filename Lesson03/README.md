# Using Variables, Declaring Constants

* variables are tools that temporarily store data for a finite duration
* constants are tools that define unalterable artifacts

## What is a Variable?

### Memory and Addressing in Brief

* memory for temporary storage is called Random Access Memory (RAM)
* In order to access a location in memory (real example here), the processor needs to be asked (via an instruction) to fetch a value from the address or write a value to the address.

### Declaring Variables to Access and Use Memory

* Pattern to define a variable: `variable_type variable_name;` or `variable_type variable_name = initial_value;` 
* The variable type attribute tells the compiler the nature of data the variable can store, and the compiler reserves the necessary space for it.
* **Initialization is good programming practice.**
